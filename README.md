# GA Final Project: Bill de Blogsio

For the final project, we were asked to build an app using a new language we had not used during the program. I chose the Opinionated Software Ruby on Rails. By using the [tutorial guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), I learned a new way to make Models, Views and Controllers, CRUD method, plus the 7 RESTful routes. 

The app uses:

* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite 3
* Bootstrap
* Yarn
* Webpack

What I found interesting were the similarities between languages. Ruby uses `puts` instead of `console.log` or `PRINTS`; it uses `do` or `end` and `until` for While Loops; uses `def` like Python, instead of `const` or `let`. Also curious were the tags `<% %>` and reference elements like `@article`. And like Python, Ruby makes migrations of its Models.
