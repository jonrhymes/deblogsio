# GA Final Project: Bill de Blogsio

For the final project, we were asked to build an app using a new language we had not used during the program. I chose Ruby on Rails and learned a new way to make Models, Views and Controllers, plus the 7 RESTful routes. 

The app uses:

* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap

It's hosted on Heroku: [Bill de Blogsio](https://deblogsio.herokuapp.com/articles)
